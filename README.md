# Hangman
Hangman is a classic word guessing game which has been enjoyed by generations and has its own legacy in the arena of computer games. It not only entertains, but also helps the user to ace vocabulary and spelling skills.

The game features dual gameplay modes:
1) User plays Hangman: Players guess letters to identify a hidden word.
2) Computer plays Hangman: The program intelligently guesses the user's word using algorithmic strategies.
